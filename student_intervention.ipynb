    "**Answer: The first supervised learning model I will fit is the decision tree. The decision tree makes rules at each node, allowing a branching effect. The way it picks the correct rule is through observing the training data. Then, based on the tree, it predicts new point by finding what node of the tree it is in. I chose this model because it is simple and can deliver fast results by splitting on impactful features. Some of the strengths of the model is it able to model on numerical and categorical data, it is easy to visualize and explain, and it is computationally efficient. Some of the weaknesses are overfitting which can be caused by over-complex trees, and instability. Different data will likely produce different trees. According to the website (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html), decision tree analysis has been used in many fields of study recently, including Agriculture, Astronomy, and Medicine. For example, decision trees have been used in Astronomy to filter out noise from Hubble Space Telescope images.\n",
    "The second supervised learning model I will fit is a perceptron. A perceptron takes all of the features and assigns weights to them. It then finds the activation, which sums up the product of the weights and its inputs. If the activation is greater than or equal to some threshold, it gives a 1. If not, 0. Then, based on the accuracy of each answer, it changes the weights. The perceptron is a classification model as well. I chose this model because it assigns weights to each feature, similar to a linear regression. It is also more robust than the decision tree. Some of the strengths of the model is its robustness, guarantee finite convergence, and it is linearly separable. Some of the weaknesses are we can only assume a linear function. According to a paper I found on this website (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01414886#page-1), multi-layered perceptron networks have been applied to two vision problems: recognition and pose estimation of 3D objects from a single 2D perspective, and handwritten digit recognition.\n",
    "The third supervised learning model I will fit is the ensemble AdaBoost. The ensemble fits a bunch of weak learners, in this case small decision trees, to the data. Each training point is initially weighted the same, but as the correctness of the model has in inverse effect on the weight of the training points. I chose this method because ensembles tend to produce better results by combining several weak models to make a powerful one. Some of the strengths of the model include accuracy, small error, and not too many causes to overfit. Some of the disadvatages are difficult to visualize and explain and requires more computational time. According to a paper I found on this website (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222425707_Classifier_ensembles_Select_real-world_applications), classifier ensembles have been used in remote sensing, person recognition, one vs all recognition, and medicine.**"

The ensemble outperforms the other tests for every training set size. I did not focus too much on the F1 score for the train set. I wanted it to be high, of course, but my preference goes with ensuring the scores for the test set are as high as possible. High F1 scores on the training set could mean overfitting of the scores are not validated by the test scores.\n",

    "**Answer: What an ensemble does is combine simple rules to form more complex rules. In this case, the AdaBoost ensemble is a boosting method. What this method does is build the rules sequentially, with the end goal being a powerful ensemble created from weak learners. A weak learner is a model that is at least slightly better than random guessing. In this case, the weak learners are small decision trees. \n",
    "Uniform weight is given to all training points. A weak learner is applied to the training set. The weights of the training points change; the weights get bigger if the model incorrectly predicts the point and smaller if the model correctly predicts the point. As more and more iterations go by, the points that are harder to predict gain more weight. Each subsequent weak learner is therefore pushed to concentrate on those points with the most weight. The final ensemble is a weighted combination of all of the predictions.**"
